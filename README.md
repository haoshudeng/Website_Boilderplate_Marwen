Dear Code & Create class! Here is a website boilerplate to get you started on your project. 
A boilerplate is a template with basic elements for every website, this time with some added bonuses of my choice. 
Please download the file, try things out, change things, add things, and make it your own.
I'm excited to see what you come up with!
